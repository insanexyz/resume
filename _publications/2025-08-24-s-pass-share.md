The goal of SpassShare is to securely share files between two clients using password as the method
of protection. In today’s world, various secure file sharing solutions exist, but they are usually very
complex and are suited for transfer of highly secure and confidential files. Despite many of them
being open source, their working mechanism is often very complicated to be understood or modified.
This can be overwhelming for users who just want to transfer simple files quickly and safely.

Thus, for sharing simple files, SpassShare can be used which aims to be very modular, customisable
and completely open source. The working mechanism of SpassShare is very simple yet effective for
simple and small file transfer, and thus the user can have confident that the software doesn’t do
anything shady or hidden. Everything in the software is transparent, and users can freely inspect the
code and see exactly how it works.

SpassShare doesn’t try to do too much. It only focuses on what is required—secure, password-based
file sharing without unnecessary complexity. It is ideal for people who want a clean and
straightforward way to send files without diving deep into complex setups or configurations. It is
meant to be easy to use, easy to understand, and reliable for the use cases it is made for.
